# Daily JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Daily JavaScript Learning Journey** repository! This repository serves as a personal log where I document my daily progress, challenges, and achievements while learning JavaScript. The goal is to stay consistent, build good coding habits, and continuously improve my JavaScript skills.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this repository is to:

- Track my learning progress and improvements.
- Share the code I write and problems I solve each day.
- Encourage others in the developer community to join me in consistent learning.
- Provide a resource for beginners who may find it helpful.

## Structure
Each day has its own folder or file that includes:

1. **Topics Covered:** A brief description of what was learned or practiced.
2. **Code Snippets:** Example code or exercises worked on.
3. **Challenges Faced:** Any difficulties or challenges encountered.
4. **Solutions/Approach:** How I approached the challenges and solved them.
5. **Additional Resources:** Links to tutorials, articles, or videos that were helpful.

## Example Entry
### Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript Basics

**Topics Covered:**
- Variables and Constants
- Data Types: String, Number, Boolean
- Basic Operators (+, -, *, /)

**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
// Declaring variables
let name = 'John';
const age = 25;

// Basic arithmetic
let sum = 10 + 5;
console.log(`The sum is: ${sum}`);
```

**Challenges Faced:**
- Understanding the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`.

**Solutions/Approach:**
- Read MDN documentation and practiced using different variable declarations in various scenarios.

**Additional Resources:**
